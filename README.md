# car-price-prediction-model
I'm thrilled to present my recent project on Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning, where I developed a robust model to accurately estimate used car prices based on multiple variables.
🔍 Project Overview:
Developed a machine learning model using Random Forest Regression to predict car prices, achieving an R-squared score of over 0.85, demonstrating strong predictive accuracy.
🛠️ Technical Implementation:

Built using Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn
Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering
Utilized Random Forest Regressor for optimal prediction accuracy
Created interactive visualizations for feature importance analysis

📊 Key Features:

Automated price prediction based on multiple parameters including:
• Car model and year
• Kilometers driven
• Fuel type
• Transmission type
• Ownership history
• Current market price

💡 Business Impact:
This model can be valuable for:

Car dealerships for inventory pricing
Insurance companies for vehicle valuation
Individual buyers and sellers in the used car market
Financial institutions for auto loan assessments

🔑 Key Learnings:

Advanced feature engineering techniques
Model optimization and hyperparameter tuning
Handling categorical variables in machine learning
Real-world application of regression algorithms

📈 Future Enhancements:
Looking to expand the model with:

Additional feature engineering
Deep learning implementation
Web interface for real-time predictions
Integration with real-time market data
